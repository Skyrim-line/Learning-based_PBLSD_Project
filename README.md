# Machine Learning-based Analysis and Intelligent Evaluation Method for Pile Foundation Low Strain Testing

## Abstract
A method for automatic determination of pile foundation integrity using low strain testing waveform data through a multi-layer LSTM neural network in MATLAB is proposed. The network aims to accurately identify unlearned data, enabling intelligent identification of pile integrity. The feasibility of this method is validated using a test sample set against the training set.

## Introduction
The widespread application of pile foundations in construction, including high-rise buildings and large bridges, underscores the importance of accurate defect detection and quality assurance. The traditional reliance on experienced personnel for data interpretation is subject to misjudgments due to subjective factors.

## LSTM Neural Network
LSTM, an improvement over the recurrent neural network model, incorporates memory units to control information retention and forgetfulness over time, which is particularly suitable for sequence data classification.

## Research Content
The project involves:
1. Manual classification of existing pile foundation low strain testing data.
2. Development of an app in MATLAB for batch manual classification.
3. Construction of an LSTM network model for automatic classification of defect levels.

## Experiment and Results
The LSTM network was trained and diagnosed on MATLAB, demonstrating a prediction accuracy of 86% for the training set and 88% for the validation set, indicating high identification precision for pile foundation low strain testing.

## Conclusion
The LSTM model showed promising results in pile integrity prediction, suggesting its potential for practical application in construction quality control.
